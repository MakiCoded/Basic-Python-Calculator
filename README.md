**Calculator Program in Python**

This is a simple calculator program written in Python. 
It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
Users can continue performing operations on results, or exit the program by typing "stop".

**Features**

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)

**How It Works**

The program prompts the user to enter the first number.
It then displays the available operations and allows the user to choose one.
The user can perform operations on two numbers at a time.
After each operation, the user is given an option to continue calculations with the current result or exit.
Typing stop ends the program.

**Code Explanation**

The code defines four basic arithmetic functions:

add(a, b): Returns the sum of a and b.
subtraction(a, b): Returns the difference of a and b.
division(a, b): Returns the division of a by b.
multiplication(a, b): Returns the product of a and b.
These functions are stored in a dictionary called mathOperations, where the keys are the operator symbols.

The Calculator() function manages user input and performs operations based on user choice. It repeatedly asks for operations and numbers until the user chooses to stop.

**Running the Program**
*To run the calculator*:

**Copy the code into a Python file (e.g., calculator.py)**

**-Execute the file in a Python environment using:**

**bash**
